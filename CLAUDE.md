## Development Commands

### Building & Running
```bash
# Install dependencies (required after clone)
pod install

# Build from command line
xcodebuild -workspace LMS_StreamTest.xcworkspace -scheme LMS_StreamTest -configuration Debug build

# Run tests
xcodebuild -workspace LMS_StreamTest.xcworkspace -scheme LMS_StreamTest -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' test

# Clean build
xcodebuild -workspace LMS_StreamTest.xcworkspace -scheme LMS_StreamTest clean
```

### CocoaPods Management
```bash
# Update dependencies
pod update

# Install with repo update
pod install --repo-update
```

**Important**: Always use `LMS_StreamTest.xcworkspace`, never the `.xcodeproj` file directly due to CocoaPods integration.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Coordinator Pattern
The app follows a coordinator pattern with `SlimProtoCoordinator` as the main orchestrator:

- **SlimProtoCoordinator**: Main coordinator managing all SlimProto components and state
- **SlimProtoClient**: Low-level protocol handler using CocoaAsyncSocket for network communication
- **AudioManager**: Singleton coordinating all audio-related components
- **SettingsManager**: Configuration and server management singleton

### Audio Architecture
The audio system is built on the CBass framework with centralized session management:

- **AudioPlayer**: CBass-based player with native BASS audio library integration supporting FLAC, AAC, MP4A, MP3, Opus, OGG
- **CBass Framework**: High-performance audio library with cross-platform support (iOS and macOS)
- **PlaybackSessionController**: Centralized iOS audio session management, interruption handling, and remote command center
- **NowPlayingManager**: Lock screen and Control Center integration with MPNowPlayingInfoCenter
- **InterruptionManager**: Legacy stub - functionality moved to PlaybackSessionController

### Position Recovery Architecture
The app uses a unified **playlist jump recovery system** that is critical for maintaining playback continuity across various scenarios:

#### **Playlist Jump Recovery (`performPlaylistRecovery`)**
**Command Structure**:
```swift
["playlist", "jump", savedIndex, 1, 0, [
    "timeOffset": savedPosition
]]
```
- `savedIndex`: Which track in playlist (e.g., track 3)
- `savedPosition`: Position within that track (e.g., 45.2 seconds)
- Last `0`: Start playing after jump, `1`: Stay paused after jump

#### **Why Playlist Jump is Critical**
Unlike simple seek commands that only change position within the current track, playlist jump provides:

1. **Track Protection**: Ensures recovery to the correct track even if playlist position changed
2. **Position Accuracy**: Handles both track and time offset in a single atomic operation
3. **Server Synchronization**: Server handles the complex logic of playlist navigation and seeking
4. **Reliability**: Works consistently across all connection states and scenarios

#### **Position Saving Triggers**
Position is automatically saved to UserDefaults during:
- **Pause Commands**: Every pause creates a recovery save point
- **Route Changes**: All audio route changes (CarPlay, AirPods, speakers) save position via `reinitializeBASS()`
- **Network Disconnection**: Connection loss saves position for recovery
- **App Backgrounding**: Position saved when app enters background
- **CarPlay Events**: Specific handling for CarPlay connect/disconnect scenarios

#### **Unified Recovery Flow**
All recovery scenarios use the same robust mechanism:

1. **Route Changes** (CarPlay, AirPods, etc.):
   ```swift
   // In reinitializeBASS()
   coordinator.saveCurrentPositionForRecovery()  // Fresh position
   coordinator.performPlaylistRecovery()         // Playlist jump
   ```

2. **Lock Screen Recovery**:
   ```swift
   // User presses play on lock screen when disconnected
   sendLockScreenCommand("play") â†’ performPlaylistRecovery()
   ```

3. **CarPlay Disconnect/Reconnect**:
   ```swift
   // Disconnect: Save â†’ Jump â†’ Pause
   // Reconnect: Save â†’ Jump â†’ Play
   ```

#### **Recovery Data Storage**
```swift
UserDefaults.standard.set(playlistCurIndex, forKey: "lyrplay_recovery_index")
UserDefaults.standard.set(currentPosition, forKey: "lyrplay_recovery_position")
UserDefaults.standard.set(Date(), forKey: "lyrplay_recovery_timestamp")
```

This unified approach eliminates timing conflicts and provides consistent behavior across all playback interruption scenarios.

### Seamless Reconnection via HELO Reconnect Bit

**NEW in v1.6.3+**: LyrPlay now implements the **HELO reconnect bit mechanism** used by squeezelite for truly seamless reconnection when app resumes from background.

#### **The Challenge**
When iOS backgrounds LyrPlay and TCP connection drops after ~3 minutes, the LMS server "forgets" the player after 300 seconds. Upon app reopening, position was lost requiring playlist jump recovery with audio blips.

#### **The Solution: Reconnect Bit (0x4000)**
Following squeezelite's proven approach, LyrPlay now sets a reconnect bit in the HELO message's `wlan_channellist` field:

```swift
// In SlimProtoClient.sendHelo():
let wlanChannels: UInt16 = isReconnection ? 0x4000 : 0x0000
```

**How it works:**
1. **First connection**: Send HELO with `0x0000` (new player)
2. **All subsequent connections**: Send HELO with `0x4000` (reconnect bit set)
3. **Server recognizes**: "Same player reconnecting" â†’ calls `playerReconnect()`
4. **Server executes**: `ContinuePlay` event with preserved position
5. **Result**: Seamless resume with NO audio blip, NO playlist jump needed!

#### **Implementation Details**
```swift
// SlimProtoClient.swift
private var isReconnection = false  // Set to true after first HELO

// After first successful HELO:
if !isReconnection {
    isReconnection = true  // All future connections are reconnections
}

// IMPORTANT: Never reset isReconnection in disconnect()
// Maintains state across backgrounding/foregrounding cycles
```

#### **Server-Side Processing** (from LMS source code)
```perl
# Slim/Networking/Slimproto.pm line 973
$reconnect = $wlan_channellist & 0x4000;

# Slim/Player/Squeezebox.pm line 70-96
if ($reconnect) {
    $client->resumeOnPower(1);      # Resume playback state
    $controller->playerReconnect($bytes_received);  # ContinuePlay event
}
```

#### **Benefits vs Playlist Jump**
- âœ… **No audio blip** - Server continues existing stream seamlessly
- âœ… **No seek artifacts** - No new stream creation or seeking required
- âœ… **Paused state preserved** - If paused before, stays paused after reconnect
- âœ… **Server-native** - Uses LMS's built-in reconnection mechanism
- âœ… **Proven approach** - Exactly how squeezelite handles backgrounding

#### **When Used**
- App resumes from background (< 300s timeout)
- Network reconnection after brief disconnection
- Any scenario where player reconnects to same server

This elegant solution eliminates the need for client-side position recovery in most scenarios, providing the smooth experience users expect from native audio apps.

### Key Dependencies
- **CocoaAsyncSocket**: Network socket communication for SlimProto
- **CBass**: Swift Package Manager integration of BASS audio library (Bass, BassFLAC, BassOpus)
- **WebKit**: Embedded Material LMS interface

### Major Fixes Completed

#### CBass Audio Framework Migration - IN PROGRESS âœ…
- **Previous Issue**: StreamingKit error 2 (STKAudioPlayerErrorStreamParseBytesFailed) when seeking into FLAC files
- **Root Cause**: StreamingKit limitations with FLAC seeking and multi-format support
- **Current Solution**: Active migration to CBass framework (BASS audio library) - Version 1.6 Build ~20
- **Benefits Achieved**:
  - Native FLAC seeking with CBass framework
  - Enhanced support for FLAC, AAC, MP4A, MP3, Opus, OGG formats
  - Superior multi-format audio handling with BASS codec integration
  - Cross-platform support (iOS and macOS)
  - Fixed phone call interruption handling with server pause/resume commands

#### Legacy FLAC Server Configuration (Still Available)
For users who want additional server-side optimization, the previous server configuration method is still documented:
- **Implementation**: Add device-specific transcode rule to LMS server's `convert.conf` file
- **Server Configuration Required**:
  ```
  # Add this rule BEFORE the default "flc flc * *" line in convert.conf
  flc flc * 02:70:68:8c:51:41
          # IFT:{START=--skip=%t}U:{END=--until=%v}D:{RESAMPLE=-r %d}
          [flac] -dcs $START$ $END$ --force-raw-format --sign=signed --endian=little -- $FILE$ | [sox] -q -t raw --encoding signed-integer -b $SAMPLESIZE$ -r $SAMPLERATE$ -c $CHANNELS$ -L - -t flac -r 44100 -C 0 -b 16 -
  ```
- **User Instructions**:
  1. Replace `02:70:68:8c:51:41` with your device's MAC address (shown in LMS web interface)
  2. Add the rule to LMS server's `convert.conf` file before existing FLAC rules
  3. Restart LMS server for changes to take effect
  4. FLAC seeking will now work properly with fresh headers on every seek operation
- **Technical Details**:
  - Forces decodeâ†’rawâ†’re-encode pipeline that generates complete FLAC headers
  - Uses LMS variables `$SAMPLESIZE$`, `$SAMPLERATE$`, `$CHANNELS$` for automatic bit depth detection
  - Handles both 16-bit and 24-bit FLAC files correctly by detecting source properties
  - Outputs consistent 16-bit FLAC for legacy StreamingKit compatibility (`-b 16` flag) - CBass handles all bit depths natively
  - Uses sox for reliable audio processing and format conversion
  - Only affects the specific iOS device, other players use normal passthrough
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal - transcoding happens in real-time on server with efficient compression level 0
- **Bit Depth Support**: Supports all FLAC bit depths (16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit) with automatic detection and conversion to 16-bit output

#### Audio Session Optimization - COMPLETED
- **Problem**: Forced sample rate settings (44.1kHz/48kHz) potentially interfering with FLAC playback
- **Solution**: Commented out forced sample rate settings in AudioSessionManager.swift
- **Files Modified**: AudioSessionManager.swift - `setupForLosslessAudio()` and `setupForCompressedAudio()`
- **Impact**: StreamingKit and audio content now determine optimal sample rates automatically

#### Silent Position Recovery System - COMPLETED
- **Problem**: Audio snippets heard during custom position recovery (play â†’ seek â†’ pause sequences)
- **Root Cause**: App-level volume control only affects StreamingKit internal volume, not system audio output
- **Solution**: Server-side volume control using LMS mixer commands for truly silent recovery
- **Implementation**: 
  - `saveServerVolumeAndMute()`: Query current server volume, save to preferences, set server volume to 0
  - `performCustomPositionRecovery()`: Execute play â†’ seek â†’ pause sequence with server muted
  - `restoreServerVolume()`: Retrieve saved volume from preferences and restore server volume
- **Files Modified**: SlimProtoCoordinator.swift - custom position recovery methods
- **Technical Details**:
  - Uses LMS JSON-RPC `["mixer", "volume", "?"]` to get current volume
  - Stores volume in player preferences: `["playerpref", "lyrPlaySavedVolume", volume]`
  - Sets server volume to 0: `["mixer", "volume", "0"]` during recovery
  - Restores original volume after recovery completes
- **Impact**: Completely silent position recovery with no audio snippets during app reopening
