- **Material Skin plugin** (install from LMS Settings ‚Üí Plugins)
- Network connection to your LMS server

### Remote Access

For remote access outside your home network, you'll need a secure VPN solution: Wireguard, Tailscale Etc. 

**Important**: Direct internet exposure of LMS servers is not recommended due to security risks. 

## Enabling FLAC Seek / Opus

LyrPlay can play MP3/AAC and FLAC without additional plugins, but for an improved experience a transcoding rules plugin has been developed [Mobile Transcode](https://github.com/mtxmiller/MobileTranscode) for ease of setup.  

To install it add below URL to ‚ÄúAdditional repositories‚Äù on your ‚ÄúManage Plug-ins page‚Äù in server configuration (at bottom).  Be sure to RESTART server after install. 

**Mobile Transcode Plugin URL:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtxmiller/MobileTranscode/main/repo.xml

If you want to **manually** configure your custom-convert.conf please see reference here: https://github.com/mtxmiller/LyrPlay/blob/main/custom-convert.conf

**Benefits:**
- **Opus 256kbps** - Bandwidth efficient modern codec for mobile devices.
- Scrub / seek for FLAC files improves recovery / state transitions with app

**NOTE ‚Äî Install Opus Tools** (required for Opus transcoding):

```bash
# Install opus-tools in your LMS container
docker exec -it lms bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y opus-tools"
```
