# BASS Audio Route Change Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: After CarPlay disconnect/reconnect or AirPods remove/insert, audio stops working despite everything appearing normal. User must background/foreground app or skip track to restore audio.

**Root Cause**: BASS audio library doesn't automatically follow iOS audio route changes on mobile platforms.

## Research & Discovery

### Key Insight from Android Forum
Found identical issue on Un4seen BASS forum (Android). User "JL" provided working solution:

**Android Working Pattern**:
```cpp
BASS_ChannelSetDevice(stream, 0)    // Move to "neutral" device
if (BASS_SetDevice(1))              // Set device context
    BASS_Free()                     // Free current device
BASS_Init(1, 44100, 0)             // Reinit on new route
BASS_ChannelSetDevice(stream, 1)    // Move stream back
```

**Key Quote from Ian (BASS author)**:
> "The 'onReceive' method could move the stream(s) to the 'No Sound' device, reinitialize the real output device, and then move the streams back to that. Not ideal, but at least you won't need to recreate the streams."

### Critical Discoveries

1. **BASS doesn't auto-follow mobile route changes** - Manual handling required
2. **Stream handles become invalid** after BASS_Free() - Must recreate streams
3. **iOS single-device model** vs Android multi-device - Different approach needed
4. **Server time vs BASS time** - Server must remain timing master

## Solution Architecture

### Component Responsibilities

**AudioPlayer** (Low-level BASS operations):
- `reinitializeBASS()` - Core BASS reinit logic
- BASS configuration and stream recreation
- Audio state management

**AudioManager** (Coordination layer):
- `handleAudioRouteChange()` - Public interface for route changes
- Delegates to AudioPlayer's reinitializeBASS()

**PlaybackSessionController** (Session/Route management):
- Route change detection via AVAudioSession notifications
- Calls AudioManager.handleAudioRouteChange()
- CarPlay-specific handling

## Implementation Details

### 1. BASS Configuration Fix ‚úÖ
**Problem**: `BASS_SetConfig(BASS_CONFIG_IOS_SESSION, 0)` called after BASS_Init
**Solution**: Move config call BEFORE BASS_Init

```swift
// BEFORE (wrong):
BASS_Init(-1, 44100, 0, nil, nil)
BASS_SetConfig(DWORD(BASS_CONFIG_IOS_SESSION), 0)

// AFTER (correct):
BASS_SetConfig(DWORD(BASS_CONFIG_IOS_SESSION), 0)  // BEFORE init
BASS_Init(-1, 44100, 0, nil, nil)
```

### 2. iOS Route Change Implementation ‚úÖ

**AudioPlayer.reinitializeBASS()** - iOS equivalent of Android solution:

```swift
func reinitializeBASS() {
    // Step 1: Save current state (CRITICAL: Use server time, not BASS time)
    let wasPlaying = (getPlayerState() == "Playing")
    let serverPosition = coordinator.getCurrentInterpolatedTime().time

    // Step 2: Clean up current stream
    cleanup()

    // Step 3: Free BASS device (equivalent to Android BASS_Free())
    BASS_Free()

    // Step 4: Configure and reinitialize BASS
    BASS_SetConfig(DWORD(BASS_CONFIG_IOS_SESSION), 0)
    BASS_Init(-1, 44100, 0, nil, nil)

    // Step 5: Request server seek to maintain position
    coordinator.requestSeekToTime(serverPosition)
}
```

### 3. Route Change Detection ‚úÖ

**PlaybackSessionController.handleRouteChange()** enhanced:

```swift
@objc private func handleRouteChange(_ notification: Notification) {
    // Log route change details...

    // CRITICAL: Reinitialize BASS for route changes
    workQueue.async { [weak self] in
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            self.playbackController?.handleAudioRouteChange()
        }
    }

    // CarPlay-specific handling...
}
```

### 4. Protocol Extension ‚úÖ

**AudioPlaybackControlling** protocol extended:

```swift
protocol AudioPlaybackControlling: AnyObject {
    func play()
    func pause()
    var isPlaying: Bool { get }
    func handleAudioRouteChange()  // NEW: Route change handling
}
```

### 5. Critical Server Time Fix ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Using BASS audio position for server seeking caused timeline jumps
**Solution**: Use server time (same as lock screen display)

```swift
// WRONG: Using BASS position
let currentPosition = getCurrentTime()  // Stale/wrong time

// CORRECT: Using server time
let interpolatedTime = coordinator.getCurrentInterpolatedTime()
let serverPosition = interpolatedTime.time  // Same as lock screen
```

**Example Timeline Issue**:
- Lock screen showing: 45.65 seconds
- BASS reporting: 24.67 seconds
- Using BASS time caused 20+ second backwards jump
- Using server time maintains proper timeline

## Testing Results

### Before Fix ‚ùå
```
üîÄ Route change detected
‚ùå Stream recreated but immediately stalls
‚ùå Position jumps backwards (45s ‚Üí 24s)
‚ùå No audio output despite "PLAYING" state
```

### After Fix ‚úÖ
```
üîÄ Route change (Old Device Unavailable)
üíæ Saving state: serverPosition=45.65, bassPosition=24.67
üîÑ BASS device freed
‚úÖ BASS reinitialized successfully
üîç   Output: Speaker (Speaker)
üì° Requested server seek to 45.65
‚úÖ Audio resumes at correct position on new route
```

## Critical Learnings & Next Steps

### ‚úÖ SYSTEMATIC TIME SOURCE ISSUE - MAJOR PROGRESS COMPLETED

**The server time vs BASS time problem existed throughout the codebase** - we've systematically fixed the major issues!

#### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED - Server Time Consistency Fixes:**
- **AudioManager route change handlers** - Now use server time instead of AudioPlayer time
- **AudioManager.getCurrentTime()** - Commented out to prevent misuse
- **SlimProtoCoordinator.getCurrentAudioTime()** - Fixed to use server time
- **NowPlayingManager fallbacks** - Updated to use dedicated fallback method
- **Foreground state updates** - Now use server time for consistency
- **Lock screen recovery** - Already using correct server time via `getCurrentTimeForSaving()`

#### üîß **Server Time Architecture Verified:**
**Interpolated Time Calculation** (SimpleTimeTracker):
```swift
// When playing:
let elapsed = Date().timeIntervalSince(serverTimeUpdated)
let interpolatedTime = originalServerTime + elapsed

// When paused:
return serverTime  // No interpolation
```

**This is identical to Material web interface logic** - Server provides time anchor, local clock calculates elapsed time.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **REMAINING TASKS:**
- [ ] **Review CarPlay recovery** mechanisms for any remaining time source issues
- [ ] **Review app open recovery** mechanisms
- [ ] **Comment out additional unused AudioPlayer time functions** if any
- [ ] **Remove debug logging** added during troubleshooting
- [ ] **Test all recovery scenarios** end-to-end

### üßπ Code Cleanup Required
The debugging implementation added extensive logging that should be removed:

#### Debug Code to Remove:
- [ ] `üîç DEBUG: Stream started - checking audio state...` logs
- [ ] `logBASSDeviceInfo()` method and calls
- [ ] `logIOSAudioSessionInfo()` method and calls
- [ ] `logStreamSpecificInfo()` method and calls
- [ ] All `üîç` prefix debug logs related to this investigation

#### Production Logging to Keep:
- [ ] Route change detection logs (`üîÄ Route change`)
- [ ] BASS reinit status logs (`‚úÖ BASS reinitialized successfully`)
- [ ] Position recovery logs (`üì° Requested server seek`)
- [ ] Error conditions and failures

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. BASS Mobile Limitations
- **BASS doesn't auto-follow route changes** on iOS/Android
- **Manual intervention required** for CarPlay, AirPods, speaker changes
- **Stream handles invalidated** after BASS_Free() - must recreate

### 2. Server as Master Architecture
- **Never use BASS time for server seeking** - causes timeline jumps
- **Server time is authoritative** - same source as lock screen display
- **Route change = audio path change** - not a timing event

### 3. iOS Audio Session Integration
- **PlaybackSessionController owns route detection** - proper architecture
- **AVAudioSession provides route change notifications** - reliable source
- **Multiple route types supported** - CarPlay, AirPods, speakers, Bluetooth

### 4. SlimProto Protocol Compatibility
- **Playlist jump approach works** - server handles seek properly
- **STMs not needed during route change** - server continues playing
- **Position recovery via server seek** - maintains protocol compliance

## Implementation Checklist

For other BASS-based iOS audio apps experiencing route change issues:

- [x] **BASS Config Order**: Set BASS_CONFIG_IOS_SESSION=0 BEFORE BASS_Init
- [x] **Route Detection**: Listen to AVAudioSession.routeChangeNotification
- [x] **BASS Reinit**: BASS_Free() ‚Üí BASS_SetConfig() ‚Üí BASS_Init() ‚Üí recreate streams
- [x] **Position Management**: Use app's master time source, not BASS time
- [x] **Stream Recreation**: Don't reuse handles after BASS_Free()
- [x] **Server Communication**: Request seek to maintain position continuity
- [ ] **Systematic Audit**: Apply server time fix to ALL recovery mechanisms
- [ ] **Code Cleanup**: Remove debugging artifacts

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation

## Current Status Summary

### ‚úÖ **MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS:**
1. **Route Change Issue SOLVED** - CarPlay, AirPods, speaker transitions working
2. **BASS Configuration Fixed** - Proper iOS session config order
3. **Server Time Architecture** - Systematic replacement of AudioPlayer time with server time
4. **Architecture Verified** - SimpleTimeTracker interpolation confirmed correct
5. **Critical Code Path Fixes** - Route handlers, fallbacks, foreground updates all use server time

### üéØ **KEY INSIGHTS GAINED:**
- **BASS doesn't follow mobile route changes** - Manual reinit required
- **Server time vs AudioPlayer time** - Major consistency issue found and largely resolved
- **Android forum solution** - Successful iOS adaptation of proven fix
- **Material web interface pattern** - Our time interpolation matches proven approach

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED FOLLOW-UP WORK:**
1. **CarPlay recovery audit** - ‚úÖ Verified proper server time usage and BASS reinit
2. **App open recovery audit** - ‚úÖ Confirmed custom position banking uses server time correctly
3. **Debug logging cleanup** - ‚úÖ Removed all route change debug methods and logs
4. **Unified Recovery Implementation** - ‚úÖ **NEW MAJOR ENHANCEMENT**

### üöÄ **UNIFIED RECOVERY STRATEGY - MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH:**
**Problem Discovered**: Dual command issue - route changes and recovery commands were conflicting
- Route change ‚Üí seek command
- CarPlay/lock screen ‚Üí playlist jump
- **Both happening simultaneously = conflicts!**

**Solution Implemented**: **Connection-Aware Smart Recovery**
- **If connected**: Use seek to maintain current stream
- **If disconnected**: Use playlist jump for full recovery
- **Eliminated dual commands** - no more conflicts!

#### **Unified Recovery Implementation Details:**

**1. Enhanced `reinitializeBASS()` (AudioPlayer.swift)**:
```swift
// Smart recovery based on connection state (same logic as lock screen)
if coordinator.isConnected {
    // Connected: Use seek to maintain current stream
    coordinator.requestSeekToTime(serverPosition)
    os_log(.info, "üîÄ Route change: Using seek (connected)")
} else {
    // Disconnected: Use lock screen play command (handles playlist jump)
    os_log(.info, "üîÄ Route change: Using playlist jump (disconnected)")
    coordinator.sendLockScreenCommand("play")
}
```

**2. Fixed CarPlay Dual Commands (PlaybackSessionController.swift)**:
- **Before**: Route change (seek) + 0.6s delay + lock screen command (playlist jump) = CONFLICT
- **After**: Route change (smart recovery) + CarPlay resume only if connected = COORDINATED

**3. Lock Screen Already Correct** ‚úÖ:
- Lock screen recovery already had connection-aware logic
- No changes needed - used as reference pattern

#### **Flow Examples:**

**CarPlay Connect (App Backgrounded)**:
```
CarPlay Detect ‚Üí handleCarPlayConnected() ‚Üí
‚îú‚îÄ Audio session active
‚îú‚îÄ BASS reinit (BASS_Free + BASS_Init)
‚îî‚îÄ Smart recovery:
   ‚îú‚îÄ If connected: seek current position
   ‚îî‚îÄ If disconnected: connect + playlist jump to saved position
```

**AirPods Remove/Insert**:
```
Route Change ‚Üí handleAudioRouteChange() ‚Üí reinitializeBASS() ‚Üí
‚îú‚îÄ BASS reinit for new route
‚îî‚îÄ Smart recovery based on connection state
```

**Lock Screen Play**:
```
Lock Screen ‚Üí sendLockScreenCommand("play") ‚Üí
‚îú‚îÄ If connected: simple play command
‚îî‚îÄ If disconnected: connect + playlist jump recovery
```
