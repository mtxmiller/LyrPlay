# Phone Call Interruption Fix

**Date:** January 14, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**File Modified:** `PlaybackSessionController.swift`

## Problem Statement

When a phone call interrupted audio playback in LyrPlay:
- ‚úÖ Music properly paused when call started
- ‚ùå Music did NOT auto-resume when call ended
- User had to manually press play to resume playback

This was inconsistent with other recovery mechanisms (lock screen recovery, route changes) which worked correctly.

## Root Causes Discovered

### 1. BASS Reinitialization During Active Calls
When a phone call started and the audio route changed to phone receiver (`.builtInReceiver` or `.bluetoothHFP`), the route change handler was reinitializing BASS. This kept the music playing **through the phone receiver during the call**.

**Why it happened:** The route change handler didn't distinguish between phone call routes and other route changes (AirPods, speakers).

### 2. iOS Interruption Ended Notification Never Fired
According to Apple's documentation: **"There is no guarantee that a begin interruption will have an end interruption."**

Testing confirmed:
- `üö´ Interruption began` notification fired ‚úÖ
- `‚úÖ Interruption ended` notification **NEVER FIRED** ‚ùå

This is a known iOS bug across multiple iOS versions, documented on Stack Overflow and Apple forums.

### 3. iOS `.shouldResume` Flag Unreliable
Even when interruption ended notifications DID fire (in some scenarios), iOS's `AVAudioSessionInterruptionOptions.shouldResume` flag was often `false` even when audio was playing before the interruption.

**Research findings:**
- Flag is unreliable for rejected calls, ignored calls, backgrounded apps
- Multiple developers report moving `play()` outside the `shouldResume` check
- Recommended approach: Trust your own `shouldAutoResume` logic, not iOS's flag

### 4. Missing BASS Reinitialization After Interruption
After interruptions, the audio route changes (phone receiver ‚Üí speaker), but BASS needs to be reinitialized to pick up the new route. The interruption ended handler didn't include this step.

## Solution Implemented

### Part 1: Prevent BASS Reinit During Phone Calls (Lines 346-357)

```swift
// PHONE CALL FIX: Detect phone call routes
let isPhoneCallRoute = currentOutputs.contains(.builtInReceiver) ||
                       previousOutputs.contains(.builtInReceiver) ||
                       currentOutputs.contains(.bluetoothHFP) ||
                       previousOutputs.contains(.bluetoothHFP)

// Skip BASS reinit for phone calls - interruption handler manages playback
if !isCarPlayEvent && !isPhoneCallRoute {
    // Only reinit BASS for AirPods, speakers, etc.
    playbackController?.handleAudioRouteChange()
}
```

**Effect:** Music stops when phone call starts (interruption handler sends pause), doesn't keep playing through phone receiver.

### Part 2: Trust Our Own Auto-Resume Logic (Lines 293-296)

```swift
// PHONE CALL FIX: Don't rely on iOS .shouldResume flag
// Apple docs: "There is no guarantee that a begin interruption will have an end interruption"
// Trust our own shouldAutoResume logic instead
let shouldResume = context?.shouldAutoResume ?? false
```

**Effect:** If interruption ended notification DOES fire, we resume based on our logic (was audio playing before interruption?), not iOS's unreliable flag.

### Part 3: BASS Reinitialization After Interruption (Lines 307-324)

```swift
case .ended:
    guard shouldResume else { return }

    ensureActive(context: .serverResume)

    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.2) {
        // Reinitialize BASS for post-interruption route
        self.playbackController?.handleAudioRouteChange()

        // Send play command after BASS is ready
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.2) {
            self.slimProtoProvider?()?.sendLockScreenCommand("play")
        }
    }
```

**Effect:** If interruption ended notification fires, properly reinitialize BASS before resuming.

### Part 4: Route-Change-Based Resume (Lines 396-417) ‚≠ê **KEY FIX**

```swift
// PHONE CALL FIX: Check if we need to resume after interruption
// iOS often doesn't fire interruption ended notification - handle resume via route change
let currentlyOnPhoneRoute = currentOutputs.contains(.builtInReceiver) ||
                            currentOutputs.contains(.bluetoothHFP)

if !currentlyOnPhoneRoute && interruptionContext != nil {
    if let context = interruptionContext, context.shouldAutoResume {
        os_log(.info, log: logger, "üìû Interruption ended via route change - auto-resuming")

        interruptionContext = nil

        // Send play command after delay to allow BASS reinit to complete
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.6) {
            self.slimProtoProvider?()?.sendLockScreenCommand("play")
        }
    }
}
```

**Why this is the key fix:**
- **Doesn't rely on interruption ended notification** (which often doesn't fire)
- **Triggered by route changes after phone call ends** (which DO fire reliably)
- **Simple logic:** If we have interruption context AND we're NOT on a phone route ‚Üí resume
- **0.6s delay** allows BASS reinitialization (from Part 1 route handler) to complete

## How It Works

### Phone Call Start Flow:
1. Phone call begins ‚Üí audio route changes to phone receiver
2. Interruption began notification fires
3. `interruptionContext` saved with `shouldAutoResume = true` (was playing)
4. Interruption handler sends pause command to server
5. Route change notification fires (to phone receiver)
6. Route handler detects `isPhoneCallRoute = true` ‚Üí **skips BASS reinit** (Part 1)
7. Music stops, phone call proceeds normally

### Phone Call End Flow:
1. Phone call ends ‚Üí audio route changes back to speaker
2. Route change notification fires (Override or Category Change)
3. Route handler checks: `isPhoneCallRoute = false` ‚Üí reinitializes BASS (Part 1)
4. BASS reinit completes: deactivates session, reinitializes device, requests playlist jump
5. Route handler checks: **"NOT on phone route AND have interruptionContext"** (Part 4)
6. After 0.6s delay: sends play command to server
7. Music resumes at saved position ‚úÖ

**Note:** Interruption ended notification may or may not fire - doesn't matter! Part 4 handles resume via route change.

## Guard Protection Against Double Reinit

The `reinitializeBASS()` method in `AudioPlayer.swift` has a guard:

```swift
guard currentStream != 0, !currentStreamURL.isEmpty else {
    return  // Skip if already cleaned up
}
```

After the first `reinitializeBASS()` call, `currentStream = 0`, so any subsequent call returns immediately. This prevents conflicts if both interruption ended AND route change fire.

## Scenarios Tested

| Scenario | Music Stops | Music Resumes | Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Phone call (regular) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Uses Part 4 (route change resume) |
| Phone call (Bluetooth) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Detects `.bluetoothHFP` route |
| Text message | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Uses Part 3 or Part 4 |
| Siri interruption | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Both approaches work |
| AirPods disconnect | ‚úÖ | N/A | Existing route handler works |
| CarPlay connect/disconnect | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Dedicated CarPlay handlers (unchanged) |

## Key Learnings

### About iOS Audio Interruptions:
1. **Never trust `AVAudioSessionInterruptionOptions.shouldResume`** - implement your own logic
2. **Interruption ended notifications are unreliable** - have a fallback mechanism
3. **Route changes are more reliable** than interruption notifications for detecting call end
4. **Phone call routes are special** - they need different handling than other route changes

### About BASS Audio Library:
1. **BASS needs reinitialization after route changes** to switch audio output devices
2. **Reinitialization involves:** `BASS_Free()` ‚Üí `BASS_Init()` ‚Üí recreate stream
3. **Guard clauses prevent double reinit** when multiple notifications fire
4. **Position recovery uses playlist jump** instead of recreating streams at specific positions

### About Timing:
1. **0.6s delay for play command** allows BASS reinit to complete
2. **0.2s delay for BASS reinit** allows audio session activation to complete
3. **Delays are necessary** because iOS audio session changes are asynchronous

## Related Issues Fixed

This fix also resolves:
- Text message interruptions not resuming
- FaceTime audio call interruptions
- Any interruption where iOS doesn't fire interruption ended notification

## Future Considerations

### If Issues Arise:
- **Music plays during call:** Check Part 1 - phone route detection may need adjustment
- **Doesn't resume after call:** Check logs for `interruptionContext` - may be `nil` or `shouldAutoResume = false`
- **Resumes too early (BASS error):** Increase delay in Part 4 (currently 0.6s)
- **Double play commands:** Check guard in `reinitializeBASS()` - may need adjustment

### Potential Enhancements:
- Monitor `CallKit` for more reliable phone call detection
- Track timing metrics to optimize delays
- Add user preference for auto-resume behavior after interruptions
