BASS doesn't expose HTTP status codes - it only reports \"stream creation success\" or \"generic network failure.\"\n\nWHAT WE ALREADY HAVE:\n✅ WebView 401 Detection (Phase 5A) - ContentView.swift handles NSURLErrorDomain code -1012\n✅ User-friendly error messages for WebView authentication failures\n✅ Fallback settings button when WebView fails to load\n\nSTREAM URL BEHAVIOR:\n- Correct credentials → BASS successfully creates stream → audio plays\n- Wrong credentials → HTTP 401 → BASS fails stream creation with generic network error\n- Cannot distinguish \"401 auth failure\" from \"server down\" or \"network issue\" at BASS level\n\nBASS LIMITATIONS:\n- BASS_StreamCreateURL() returns 0 on ANY network failure\n- BASS_ErrorGetCode() returns generic error codes (not HTTP-specific)\n- No HTTP response code exposure in BASS API\n- URL-embedded auth is transparent to BASS (handled by HTTP layer)\n\nCURRENT ERROR HANDLING:\nAudioPlayer already logs stream creation failures:\n- \"Failed to create stream: [generic BASS error]\"\n- \"Stream error detected: [error code]\"\n- These cover auth failures (they just look like network errors)\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nPhase 6 implementation would require:\n1. Custom HTTP layer to intercept 401 responses BEFORE passing to BASS\n2. Significant architectural changes to AudioPlayer/SlimProtoCommandHandler\n3. Complexity without clear user benefit (they'll see \"stream failed\" either way)\n\nBETTER APPROACH:\n1. Test Phase 7 with wrong credentials to see actual user experience\n2. If stream failures with wrong auth are unclear, add guidance:\n   \"Stream failed to load. If your server requires authentication, check Settings.\"\n3. Connection test in settings could validate auth before attempting playback\n\nCONCLUSION:\nPhase 6 as originally scoped (monitoring BASS errors for 401) is not feasible with URL-embedded credentials. The HTTP 401 happens below BASS's visibility. Consider Phase 6 complete via Phase 5A (WebView 401 handling), or rescope to add connection testing.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-07T06:21:44.97835-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-07T12:34:49.500056-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-07T12:34:49.500056-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"LMS_StreamTest-60n","depends_on_id":"LMS_StreamTest-afv","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-07T06:22:02.651678-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

With BASS_DEVICE_FREQ, should we use content rate or max device rate?\n2. Does BASS auto-detect stream rate if device rate is different?\n3. How to handle multiple sample rate families (44.1 vs 48)?\n4.
